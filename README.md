## About

These are initially updates to existing themes available freely elsewhere, modified to fit personal needs. The modifications involve additions of a few previously missing XML definitions for keys otherwise available to Sublime Text 2.

### colinsole

Modification of "Twilight" by Michael Sheets. This is a dark theme I preferred over others, except that its contrast was too high in various cases. The colors for rulers and guides (indentation depth) as well as the border between the gutter and code have been tweaked to be more usable. Additionally, there used to be a Guard/RSpec terminal-related issue where the terminal would not hold onto the correct theme, and I believe this was an attempt to unify the themes.

### Colarized (Light)

Modification of "Solarized (Light)" in order to similarly accentuate the rulers, guides, and gutter demarcations for clarity.

## Usage

 * Add these files to your ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User directory
 * Within Sublime Text 2, select "Sublime Text 2" > "Preferences" > "Color Scheme" > "User" > [name of scheme]

## Future

If there ends up being more additions, likely including completely original themes, this will be moved to Package Control.
